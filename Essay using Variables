#''String Variables Exercise'''
# ask a user to enter their first name and store it in a variable
First_name=input("Please enter your first name: ")
# ask a user to enter their last name and store it in a variable
Last_name=input("Please enter your last name: ")
# print their full name
# Make sure you have a space between first and last name
# Make sure the first letter of first name and last name is uppercase
# Make sure the rest of the name is lowercase
print("\nHello" + " " + First_name.capitalize() + " " + Last_name.capitalize())

#'''Numeric Variables Exercise'''
# Ask a user to enter a number
First_number=input("\nPlease enter the first number: ")
# Ask a user to enter a second number
Second_number=input("Please enter the second number: ")
# Calculate the total of the two numbers added, subtracted, multiplied and divided
Answer1=int(First_number) + int(Second_number)
Answer2=int(First_number) - int(Second_number)
Answer3=int(First_number) * int(Second_number)
Answer4=int(First_number) / int(Second_number)
# Be sure to have a print statement for each operation
print("\nFirst number + Last name = Answer")
print(str(First_number) + " " + "+" + " " + str(Second_number) + " " + "=" + " " + str(Answer1))
print("\nFirst number - Second Number = Answer")
print(str(First_number) + " " + "-" + " " + str(Second_number) + " " + "=" + " " + str(Answer2))
print("\nFirst number * Second Number = Answer")
print(str(First_number) + " " + "*" + " " + str(Second_number) + " " + "=" + " " + str(Answer3))
print("\nFirst number / Second Number = Answer")
print(str(First_number) + " " + "/" + " " + str(Second_number) + " " + "=" + " " + str(Answer4))

#'''Combining Both to Create an Essay'''
# Give me an brief paragraph that will include details about you
Colleges=("Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Standford University, and Princeton University.")

# Be sure to include variables for all colleges you are applying to
# What your GPA is and a calculation that will demonstrate how to increase it
# Finally, which activities you are involved in
# The purpose of this will see how well you can generate a paragraph through print statements
# string and numeric variables
# Comments should include brief explanations of different sections of your code
